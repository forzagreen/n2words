            The subject "{subject}" found in the pull request title "{title}"
            didn't match the configured pattern. Please ensure that the subject
            starts with a lowercase letter.

            Examples:
              ✓ feat: add new language support
              ✓ fix(core): handle edge case in AbstractLanguage
              ✓ docs: update README with examples

              ✗ feat: Add new language (subject should start with lowercase)
              ✗ added feature (missing type prefix)
