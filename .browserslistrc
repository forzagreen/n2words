# Browserslist configuration
# Used by Babel and other tools to determine browser support targets
#
# Strategy: Target all in-use browsers (defaults) that support BigInt (hard requirement).
#
# The source code (src/) uses modern ES2022+ features but Babel transpiles these down to
# be compatible with BigInt-supporting browsers.
#
# "defaults" = > 0.5% usage, last 2 versions, Firefox ESR, not dead
# Filtering by "supports bigint" excludes KaiOS 2.5 and Opera Mini (can't run BigInt)
#
# This query targets ~86% of global users (all in-use browsers with BigInt support).
# See: https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#queries

# Target all in-use browsers that can run BigInt (non-polyfillable)
defaults and supports bigint
